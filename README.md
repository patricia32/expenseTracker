# 💸 Expense Tracker App

A simple yet functional expense tracking mobile application built with **React Native**, developed as part of the **_React Native – The Practical Guide_** course published by **[O’Reilly](https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/react-native/9781789139747/9781789139747-video8_1/)**.

This ongoing project helps users **view, add, edit, and delete their transactions**, while also exploring best practices in UI/UX design, state management, and backend integration.


## 📱 Project Overview

This app allows users to track their personal expenses with a clean and user-friendly interface. It includes three main screens:

- **Recent Expenses** – shows transactions from the last 7 days.
- **All Expenses** – lists all user-entered transactions.
- **Manage Expense** – screen for creating or editing a transaction.

All navigation is handled with **React Navigation** and persistent data is stored using **Firebase** and managed via **Axios**.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **React Native** – Cross-platform mobile development
- **React Navigation** – Screen navigation (stack + bottom tabs)
- **Context API** & **Redux** – For global state management
- **Axios** – For network requests to backend (Firebase)
- **Firebase** – As a backend/database for storing expense data
- **Props & State** – For handling local component logic
- **Async Storage / Firebase** – Explored multiple options for persistent data
